# Look at me

“Look At Me” is a pensive self-analysis written by a man questioning his place in the world at a time when he was at his most influential but yearned for the simplicity of the personal connection.

# SongFacts

1. When Lennon came to record his debut solo album, the lyrics of ‘Look At Me’ were a perfect fit. Its questions – “Who am I supposed to be?”; “What am I supposed to do?”; “Who am I?”; “Who are we?” – may have emerged from a period in which his marriage to Cynthia Lennon and his place within The Beatles were both being questioned, but in the wake of his Primal Therapy in 1970 it provided a continuation of the self-analysis that ran throughout John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band.
2. The John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band recording also had double-tracked vocals by Lennon; the opening “OK?” “Yes thank you” showed that Lennon never lost his sense of humour, even when his lyrics were at his most soul-baring.
